# ML-Financial-Forcasting

This is a deep learning binary classification model using Python and Pytorch's Deep Learning Library. We used a deep neural network with 4 hidden layers to discovernon-linear trends within the data. The model only uses financial data as features to produce output statistics like accuracy, recall, precision on the machine's predictions.
